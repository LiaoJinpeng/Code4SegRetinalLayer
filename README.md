# Segmentation Code for B@I1 Group in UW.

Acknowledgement: Thanks for friendly and kindly BAIL group member in UW.  
Here is a TensorFlow-based Deep Learning code for Retina Layer Segmentation.
The ReadMe will contain two section: 1) Environment Setup; 2) How to Use this Code.

Dear Bail group member,

If you want to use below code for OCT retinal layer segmentation, please follow the instruction. 

# Environment 

To easily run the code for segmentation task, please follow the below instruction step-by-step.

- Type 1: Very fast demo for testing.
(1) Find the 'Config.py' in folder 'Configuration', then change the parameter which marked with 'TODO'.

(2) Open the 'Main.py' and change the filepath of image data and label data; then run the 'Main.py'.

hint: a demo-used data is available in the folder 'Dataset->retina seg test data'.
